      # NOTE: This step should NOT run inside a docker container, since this

        #     images contain either compiled binaries, artifacts, or scripts and
        #     whatever is needed for these "things" to run successfully). As of
        #     writing, we want to avoid docker-in-docker because of the complexity.
